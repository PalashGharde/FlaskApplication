## Features

User Data Entry: Log daily health data including workout duration, meditation time, and sleep hours.

Dashboard: Visual representation of health metrics using charts.

Database Integration: Uses SQLite to store user data.

Templating Engine: Jinja2 is used for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
